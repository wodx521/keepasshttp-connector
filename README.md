# KeePassHttp-Connector

is an extension to integrate [KeePass](http://keepass.info)/[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) as a password manager with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.

They require [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/), a KeePass plugin to expose password entries securely (256bit AES/CBC) over HTTP.

It was forked from [chromeIPass/passIFox](https://github.com/pfn/passifox), with support for newer versions of Firefox (42+).

## Beta Testers Wanted!

I am looking for beta testers who use KeePass (not KeePassXC) and want to try out the next iteration of KeePassHttp. [KeePassNatMsg](https://github.com/smorks/keepassnatmsg) is a re-write of KeePassHttp using native messaging for web browsers. It currently works great with the [keepassxc-browser](https://github.com/varjolintu/keepassxc-browser) browser extension, which fixes some of the issues that KeePassHttp-Connector currently has.

If you are interested, head over to the [KeePassNatMsg](https://github.com/smorks/keepassnatmsg) page for downloads & installation instructions, and please report any issues there. Thank-you!
